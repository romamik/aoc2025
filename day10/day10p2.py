"""
initially the counters are all zero
pressing a button increments wired counters by one
we want to get counters to given state

we can view this as a set of linear equations:
let's form matrix, such that mat[cnt][btn] = how button btn affects counter cnt (1 or 0)

we want to find such vector p, where p[btn] - number of presses on the button btn such that mat * p == target
where target[cnt] is the desired final state for the counter cnt

each row in the matrix row=mat[cnt] together with target[cnt] forms a linear equation:
sum(row[btn]*p[btn] for each btn) = target[cnt]

we want to solve this set of equations to find p[btn] such that sum(p) is minimal (total number of button presses)

we can modify these equations:
we have remaining equations and modified equations
at each step we select on variable (btn) and move one equation to modified set, 
and modifying the remaining set such that row[btn] == 0 in each equation (so p[btn] is not used in this equation)
for this we select first equation that has nonzero row[btn] and for every other equation that has nonzero row[btn]
we create a new equation by multipling both by row[btn] from other equation and subtracting.

when we have the reduced equations we can try to solve them. there can be different number of free variables.

we can have a function that takes some known variables and tries to deduce other variables based on this,
the result of such operation can be some or all arguments known or there is contradiction

with such function we can have another function that calls itself recursively to guess the correct values, 
it should select values that bound minimal number of other values for this process to be effective
